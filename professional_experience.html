          Resume`s are super lame. That's what <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedtash/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> is for (not for being lame, but for resume` hosting..ok and also <a href="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/blog/linkedin-has-become-a-piece-of-garbage-even-more-than-usual/" target="_blank">for being lame.</a> )

          Professionally I bring a lot of fun to the office. Have great people skills and genuinely enjoy getting to know people and laughing as we work together. If you can't have fun working, something is wrong.

          I think the most important skill in dev is being able to figure it out (replace "it" with whatever the thing is you are trying to figure out). Maybe it's just me being a lowly old bootcamper but I believe that there is a great big internet out there with lots of open source contributors, blog posts, stack overflows, and of course: AI chatbots. Coming from a background in healthcare, I have been genuinely impressed with how friendly and helpful people in the software ecosystem are. I mean I literally learned python  <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw" target="_blank">from a guy in a giraffe T-shirt</a> (just kidding, he's not just a guy, he's Mike Dane!) for free on YouTube. And I built this site in like 30 minutes with ChatGPT and a single quick google search.

          Professionally I have been exposed to asset management, particularly a custom site for building code and ADA compliance. Have experience with e-commerce, particularly in platform (shopify, YouTube, Facebook, etc) integrations. I also have a host of experience across several Department of Education projects including gathering/reporting survey data, creating custom data dashboards, and event registration (that application alone has >35k users).

          My experience is in Rails. In addition to Rails, I use Turbo-Hotwire, ViewComponents, and a whole host of usual suspect Gems (looking at you, Devise). I also use stimulus-rails for clientside JS; but obviously with Rails most of the heavy lifting is done on the server.
